    </tbody>
</table>


Installation
------------

Download the Web Application aRchive (WAR) and drop it in the deploy folder of your favorite container (Tomcat, JBoss, ...).
In your browser, open <http://localhost:8080/scrutmydocs/>

### Deploy locally

If you don't have a Java container (like Tomcat, JBoss, ...) but want to test ScrutMyDocs into your local machine can try to run it with the following command (tested on Ubuntu).

Download jetty-runner from official repository:

 * http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/mortbay/jetty/jetty-runner/

currently latest version is 8.1.5.v20120716 so:

```sh
wget http://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/mortbay/jetty/jetty-runner/8.1.5.v20120716/jetty-runner-8.1.5.v20120716.jar
```

install required SDK:

```sh
sudo apt-get install openjdk-6-jdk
```

download ScrutMyDocs:

```sh
wget https://github.com/downloads/scrutmydocs/scrutmydocs/scrutmydocs-0.3.0.war
```

and run application with:

```sh
java -jar jetty-runner-8.1.5.v20120716.jar scrutmydocs-0.3.0.war
```

now you can see ScrutMyDocs on your local machine, open the browser and open the page:

 * http://localhost:8080/

NOTE: please configure also _elasticsearch_, see next section.

Setup
-----

### Embedded node

By default, ScrutMyDocs web application contain all you need to start. So Elasticsearch is embedded and
you have only to start your container to see it live!

### Connect to Elasticsearch Cluster

If you want to use an external ElasticSearch cluster, you will have to set it up.

#### Download and install Elasticsearch

##### Linux (Debian-like)
```sh
curl -L -C - -O https://github.com/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-0.90.0.deb
dpkg -i elasticsearch-0.90.0.deb
```

##### OSX
With [Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/)
```sh
brew install elasticsearch
```

#### Add required plugins

[mapper-attachment](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments), [fsriver](https://github.com/dadoonet/fsriver), [google-drive-river](https://github.com/lbroudoux/es-google-drive-river)

```sh
service elasticsearch stop
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-mapper-attachments/1.7.0
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install fr.pilato.elasticsearch.river/fsriver/0.2.0
/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/plugin -install com.github.lbroudoux.elasticsearch/google-drive-river/0.0.1
```

#### Configure elasticsearch.yml node property file

```
# Mandatory cluster Name. You should be able to modify it in a future release.
cluster.name: scrutmydocs
# If you want to check plugins before starting
plugin.mandatory: mapper-attachments, river-fs
# If you want to disable multicast
discovery.zen.ping.multicast.enabled: false
```

#### Launch Elasticsearch nodes

```sh
service elasticsearch start
```

Then, you will have to configure ScrutMyDocs to connect to your cluster. By default, ScrutMyDocs will connect on
localhost:9300 node with cluster name scrutmydocs.

#### Modify scrutmydocs settings

The first time you launch scrutmydocs web application, it will create a file named `~/.scrutmydocs/config/scrutmydocs.properties`.
Just create or edit this file to adjust your parameters. Here is a 
[sample file](https://github.com/scrutmydocs/scrutmydocs/tree/master/src/main/resources/scrutmydocs/config/scrutmydocs.properties).

Modify the following settings:

```
# Set to false if you want to connect your webapp to an existing Elasticsearch cluster, default to true
node.embedded=false
# If false, you have to define your node(s) address(es), default to : localhost:9300,localhost:9301
node.addresses=localhost:9300
```

If you want to use Dropbox rivers, you must define first your dropbox credentials for your own
[Dropbox Application](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps):

```
# If you want to use Dropbox river, define your App key and Secret here
# You can create your application on https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps
dropbox.app.key=yourkeyhere
dropbox.app.secret=yoursecrethere
```

You can now deploy the web application in your container.


Scrut My Docs REST API Resources
================================

Common based API
----------------

API are running at scrutmydocs/api point. It could be a nice idea to use a proxy to
rewrite urls.

Let say you are running scrutmydocs at http://scrutmydocs.org/scrutmydocs/, you should set your proxy to rewrite
* http://api.scrutmydocs.org to http://scrutmydocs.org/scrutmydocs/api/ and
* http://demo.scrutmydocs.org to http://scrutmydocs.org/scrutmydocs/

Then, the common base URL for API will be http://api.scrutmydocs.org


Each API provide help with the `_help` entry point.

```sh
curl 'localhost:8080/scrutmydocs/api/_help'    					 
```

The following command will give you existing APIs.

```sh
curl 'localhost:8080/scrutmydocs/api/'    					 
```




REST Response are always based on the following JSON content:
```javascript
{
   "ok":true,
   "errors":null,
   "object":null
}
```

Ok indicates if there was something wrong during API execution.
If `ok` is `false`, you should find errors in `errors` property.

```javascript
{
   "ok":false,
   "errors":[
      "This is a first error",
      "This is a second error"
   ],
   "object":null
}
```

When needed, the API can return an object. For example, if you ask for a river detail, you should find
it in the `object` property:

```javascript
{
   "ok":true,
   "errors":null,
   "object":{
      "type":"fs",
      "analyzer":"standard",
      "url":"/tmp_es",
      "updateRate":30,
      "includes":null,
      "excludes":null,
      "name":"myfirstriver",
      "id":"myfirstriver",
      "start":false,
      "indexname":"docs",
      "typename":"doc"
   }
}
```

The returned object depends on the API you use.

Document
--------

You can manage your documents with the Document API.

	    </tr>
	    <tr>
			<td>POST 1/doc</td>
			<td>Add a document to the search engine (see Document object).</td>
	    </tr>
	    <tr>
			<td>DELETE 1/doc/{id}</td>
			<td>Delete a document in the default index/type (doc/docs).</td>

### JiraRiver Object

A JiraRiver object looks like (see https://github.com/jbossorg/elasticsearch-river-jira for updated details):

```javascript

```

* `id` is the unique name of your river. It is generated with a "trim()" on the river name parameter. Used to get or delete the river.
* `name` is a fancy name for the river.
* `indexname` is where JIRA components documents will be send
* `typename` is the type name under your JIRA compoents will be indexed. For the moment only jira_issue are processed.

* `urlBase` is the base URL of the JIRA Instance
* `username` is the JIRA account user name
* `pwd` is the JIRA account user password
* `jqlTimeZone` is optional identifier of timezone used to format time values into JQL when requesting updated issues. Timezone of ElasticSearch JVM is used if not provided.
* `timeout` is time value, defines timeout for http/s REST request to the JIRA. Optional, 5s is default if not provided.
* `maxIssuesPerRequest` defines maximal number of updated issues requested from JIRA by one REST request. Optional, 50 used if not provided.
* `projectKeysIndexed` is a comma separated list of JIRA project keys to be indexed. If omitted all visible projects are fetched.
* `indexUpdatePeriod` is time value, defines how often is search index updated from JIRA instance. Optional, default 5 minutes.
* `maxIndexingThreads` defines maximal number of parallel indexing threads running for this river.
* `jiraIssueCommentType` defines the elasticsearch type used to index JIRA Issue Comments.
* `jiraRiverActivityIndexName` defines the index where JIRA River Activities are sent.
* `jiraRiverUpdateType` defines the elasticsearch type used to index JIRA River updates events.

> Some parameters are readonly for the moment in order to set JIRA River easily. Otherwise, there are required mapping to set before creating a JIRA River
